User: what is backpropgartion
Assistant: Backpropagation is a common algorithm used for training artificial neural networks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that helps the neural network learn from its mistakes by adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons. 

The algorithm works by propagating the error backwards from the output layer to the input layer, updating the weights and biases in each layer as it goes. It uses a gradient descent optimization technique to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. 

In simple terms, backpropagation is a way for the neural network to learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy over time.
